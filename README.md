# Medical Machine Learning Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating common machine‑learning workflows on several open health datasets.

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Breast_cancer_projects.ipynb](Breast_cancer_projects.ipynb) | Classification of the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using KNN, SVM and cross validation. |
| [DNA+CLASSIFICATION.ipynb](DNA+CLASSIFICATION.ipynb) | Classifies promoter gene sequences from the UCI Molecular Biology dataset. Demonstrates preprocessing DNA sequences and evaluating models such as k‑nearest neighbors and Gaussian processes. |
| [Diabetes_Udemy.ipynb](Diabetes_Udemy.ipynb) | Uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (`diabetes.csv`) to build a neural network. Includes data standardization, handling missing values and evaluating model performance. |
| [Heart_disease_project.ipynb](Heart_disease_project.ipynb) | Exploratory data analysis and neural network model on the Cleveland heart disease dataset (`Ch3.ClevelandData.csv`). |
| [Heart+Disease+Prediction+with+Neural+Networks.ipynb](Heart+Disease+Prediction+with+Neural+Networks.ipynb) | Loads the processed Cleveland dataset from UCI, converts the labels for multi‑class classification and trains a neural network with Keras. |

## Datasets

| File | Source |
|------|-------|
| [diabetes.csv](diabetes.csv) | Pima Indians Diabetes dataset |
| [Ch3.ClevelandData.csv](Ch3.ClevelandData.csv) | Cleveland heart disease dataset |

Other notebooks download their data directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and do not require local files.

Both CSV files above were obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and are redistributed here solely for convenience. Usage of these datasets remains subject to the terms listed on their respective repository pages.

## Running the notebooks locally

1. Create a Python environment (Python 3.8 or newer is recommended).
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This installs Jupyter along with the required libraries.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open any `.ipynb` file from the interface to run the code. You can also upload the notebooks to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for execution in the cloud.

Datasets included in this repository (`diabetes.csv` and `Ch3.ClevelandData.csv`) are ready to use. Notebooks that reference online sources will automatically download the data when run.

## Contributing

Before submitting changes, please clear the outputs of all notebooks so Git diffs remain readable. You can do this automatically by running:

```bash
scripts/clear_outputs.sh
```

This script runs `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace` on every `.ipynb` file in the repository.
